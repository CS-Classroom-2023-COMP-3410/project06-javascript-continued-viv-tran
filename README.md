**Objective**:
Develop an interactive web project that runs entirely in the browser, without requiring a backend. This assignment will challenge you to explore new ideas, add features incrementally, and push the limits of what you can implement using only frontend technologies. You will use ChatGPT as a coding assistant to build your project iteratively until you reach a feature that cannot be successfully implemented.

---

**Requirements**:

1. **Choose a Project**  
   - Select a project that can be built entirely on the frontend (i.e., no database, no server-side logic, and no complex security requirements).
   - You may either:
     - Invent a new project idea.
     - Expand on one of the 10 projects from the previous assignment.

2. **Develop Iteratively**  
   - Continue adding features to your project through incremental development.
   - Use ChatGPT to assist in implementing new functionality.
   - Keep improving and expanding the project until you reach a point where ChatGPT is unable to correctly implement a new feature.

3. **Identifying a Stuck Feature**  
   - The feature where ChatGPT fails **must** meet the following criteria:
     - It is clearly understandable by everyone in the class.
     - The expected outcome is easy to describe.
     - It is a reasonable feature for a frontend project (i.e., no deliberately impossible or misleading tasks).
     - You have attempted to implement this feature at least three times using ChatGPT, and all attempts have failed.

---

**Submission Requirements**:

Your **GitHub Classroom repository** must include the following:

1. **Project Files**  
   - The fully working state of your website **before** attempting the new feature.
   - Ensure that all necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are included.
   
2. **`new_feature.md`**  
   - A markdown file that describes:
     - The new feature you attempted to add.
     - Why it is a reasonable feature to expect in a frontend project.
     - How it was supposed to work.
     - How ChatGPT failed to implement it.

3. **`conversation.md`**  
   - A markdown file that contains:
     - The complete conversation history between you and ChatGPT, including:
       - The development process leading up to the fully working project.
       - The three or more failed attempts to implement the final feature.

---

**Assessment Criteria**:

1. **Project Functionality**  
   - Does the submitted project work correctly before attempting the final feature?  
   - Are previous features implemented properly?

2. **Clarity of the Stuck Feature**  
   - Is the requested feature well-defined and reasonable?  
   - Is it clear why the feature was expected to work but failed?

3. **Iteration Process**  
   - Have you demonstrated an iterative approach by implementing multiple features before reaching the failure point?  
   - Does the conversation log show a logical progression of development?  

4. **Completion**  
   - Are all required files included in the GitHub repository?  
   - Does `conversation.md` include at least three failed attempts to implement the final feature?  

---

**Submission Instructions**:

1. Push all required files to your GitHub Classroom repository.
2. Verify that your project runs correctly in its last working state.
3. Ensure that `new_feature.md` and `conversation.md` clearly document the final unsuccessful feature attempt.
