I actually found this project to be very difficult as every time i thought i stumped chatgpt, on my next round of clarification or reprompting it, it would find a way to do exactly what i was asking. It sometimes took more than one prompt, but still, it would eventually get there. I attempted to add many different features such as a racecar visual that reflected the user's typing progress, but the one where it got stuck is when the user selects a difficulty of medium, the user should then be prompted to enter a letter and the resulting typing prompt should only consist of words that began with that letter. The sentence should be totally randomized.
